# Game-Character
Creates a character with user given statistics.

The character program implements an application that prompts the user for various information needed to fill out every mv (member variable) of the class. There are four string mv's and 6 integer mv's. It then neatly displays all the information given to the prompts next to its corresponding attribute. Below that, it shows the total of all the integer attributes added together.
